To create a backend,Set up a Python backend framework, such as Flask or Django, to handle the HTTP requests and responses.

pip install pandas scikit-learn flask  

Create a Python file for backend application example app.py for Flask.

import pandas as pd
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  

with open('idmanual.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
features = [item['description'] for item in data]
labels = [item['status'] for item in data]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer() 
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
model = SVC()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

For Flask:
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    descriptions = data['descriptions']

    # Preprocess the descriptions (if needed)
    preprocessed_descriptions = preprocess(descriptions)

    # Vectorize the preprocessed descriptions
    X = vectorizer.transform(preprocessed_descriptions)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X)

    # Return the predictions as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'predictions': predictions.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

python app.py


Now send HTTP POST requests to the /predict endpoint with JSON data containing the "descriptions" field to get predictions in return.
